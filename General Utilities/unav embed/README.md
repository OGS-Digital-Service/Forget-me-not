# What do I do with these?

As of the most recent update to this repo (03/2023), these embeds for unav header & footer should be used on all official and trusted NYS websites and applications. They form the universal navigation that is appended to the top of the page as well as the universal footer that should be placed at the bottom of the page below all other footers. 

The header embed should be placed at the top of the <code>body</code> and the footer below all other footers, still within the <code>body</code>. 

The remote js will append the proper header and footer to the page. unav-demo.html has been included for reference and may not load locally or in containerized environments where remotes are not reachable. Example at https://nysds.dev/unav-demo/
