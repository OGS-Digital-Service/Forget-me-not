# 4 across Icon Frame for WYSIWYG

This is a 4 across icon frame with heading and text for embed in an ACSF wysiwyg, currently used on [https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass]

Embed all the code into the source of the full html view of a wysiwyg as done with other custom embeds.

This is built using tailwind for styling and all the utility classes used here are in the minified css at the top of the embed. Tailwind uses a ":" modifier to indicate a state change (breakpoint change) and different parameters. It's mobile first so any style that isn't prefixed is valid from the smallest breakpoint up and only different states at desktop/tablet or larger are indicated.
