# Homepage Fixes for Covid19Vaccine ACSF site

These are style overrides to do the following:

- change the hero enclosing div to have a background color of black with 70% opacity in order to darken and provide better contrast ratio for overlay text
~~ -  change the bio frame button to have a blue background with black hover to meet 4.5:1 contrast ~~
~~ - change the get involved frame in blue to have a blue button with black hover to meet contrast ~~
~~ - change link text color in the frames to slightly darker blue to meet contrast ~~
- Update as of 3/30/23: color palette changes to the distribution mean only the hero modification is needed anymore. Everything else has been removed and archived.
