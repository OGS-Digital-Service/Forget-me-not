# Homepage Fixes for Covid19Vaccine ACSF site

These are style overrides to do the following:

- change the hero enclosing div to have a background color of black with 70% opacity in order to darken and provide better contrast ratio for overlay text
- change the bio frame button to have a blue background with black hover to meet 4.5:1 contrast
- change the get involved frame in blue to have a blue button with black hover to meet contrast
- change link text color in the frames to slightly darker blue to meet contrast


To use this on the homepage:
- copy everything in the embed-code.html file into a wysiwyg in full html source view
- turn off source but leave in full html and save the page 
- check to see that everything isn't broken
- panic
- delete if broken
