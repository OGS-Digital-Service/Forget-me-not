# DOL Chatbot
This is an astutebot embed from Verizon.

For this to work on an ACSF site you need administrator access to use the WYSIWYG full html source option. 
1. Add WYSIWYG Paragraph to any page where it is available
2. Change the editor view to "Full HTML"
3. Click the "Source" button in the editor to turn on source code view
4. Paste the embed code at the very bottom of the source view being careful to use the entire code snippet and not break any existing tags.
5. Click the "Source" button in the editor to turn off source code view
6. Save the page

*note* if you change the editor view to something other than "Full HTML" or if you do not have administrator access, then problems will happen with saving the page or the bot embed code may not work properly.
